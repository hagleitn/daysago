Ever wonder if that piece of fish in the fridge is still good? How long has it been in there? Well, build one of these and stick it on your leftovers. StillGood will keep count of the days for you. No more guessing.

# Usage

If the display is off a single button press will bring it back to life. The display will turn off every 5 minutes to preserve power. Once activated the display will show the number of days since the last reset. The display only shows two digits, so it will wrap around every 100 days.

## Reset

When the display is active a push of the button will reset the number to "0". Count up will start again.

## Setting the number manually

A long press will enter into manual adjust mode. The number on the display starts blinking, which indicates the device is ready to receive clicks to increase the count. If no button presses are received for 5 seconds the device returns to normal operation.

## Changing the interval

By default the device counts up by one every day. However stillgood can also count every hour, minute or second. A double click on the button will cycle through the different modes. The display will indicate which mode is active after the change (d for day, h for hour, m for minute, s for second).
